* Handle player linking to user and club.
* Generate admin panel UI with permissions check.

### Outputs:

* Authenticated routes in Remix.
* Supabase policies for secure access.
* Tests for user flows.

* Automate build pipeline (e.g., with GitHub Actions).
* Provide scripts for deploying to platforms like Vercel or Railway.
* Run performance profiling and suggest optimizations.

### Outputs:

* CI/CD config.
* Deployment guide.
* Performance report.

---

## ðŸ”„ Ongoing: Testing, Maintenance, and Documentation

### Tasks:

* Generate unit, integration, and E2E tests.
* Maintain up-to-date documentation.
